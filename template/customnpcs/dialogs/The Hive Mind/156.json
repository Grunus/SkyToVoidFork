The stages of grief, as they call themselves, they will all try and trick you into believing you are the true enemy, but you are not. More so, they will create haunting and vicious copies of your close friends and individuals you've encountered. As long as you maintain an established relationship with your doomed friends, you will come out on top.

The first four gods, they are not a problem. Vanquish them and you will come out on top. 

But Acceptance, as he has named themselves. I handed out a shred of my power to him, and he used that power to disable my own capabilities. But a simple fix, it is merely a phrase you must say in front of him to enable my full potential. I can finally take over the throne, and if you don't mind, I have my own personal grudge with Acceptance, so I'll deal with him, and we'll both come out on top.

But before I give you the phrase, we need The Obelisk activated with the last key. I shall write down some of my instructions in your book of yours.

And remember, @p. We will restore the kingdom, together.
