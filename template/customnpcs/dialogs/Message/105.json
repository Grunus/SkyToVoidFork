    "DialogText": "One generation, after being struck with an intense ill so dark and mysterious. After being invaded by hordes of monsters. After living in deathly conditions, this generation decided to change their fate. A brave request was called to the gods. A request monumental that will alter the rest of eternity.

A kingdom to house the gone souls was requested. This kingdom would provide eternal peace for the residents. This kingdom comprised of believers would stand side by side with the gods. A request on this scale has never been proposed in any generation. And so the gods listened then responded.
