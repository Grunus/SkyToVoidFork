    "DialogText": "Our generation was the downfall of this place, maybe the downfall of the world. We've gone so far to try and travel through dimensions to escape this world and create a society we wanted. Once we discovered the possibility of dimensional travel we completed a man-made portal. We wanted to see a world with a star or wind blowing, or a blue sky. Something our entire generation only seen in virtual spaces.

We've made a connection, we commenced the light bridge, only to find out the other side was waiting for us. Dark creatures swarmed our facility and invaded our home. The horror screams these creatures made. I hid in my room, blocked off the my basement entrance and hope to survive. After a few days, I went up to see a bright, blue sky, with an orange ball floating above me.

Seeing a star, wasn't worth destroying the planet...",
