    "DialogText": "Yes the purple witch water as I like to call it. I'm sure it gives you severe malaise, but I'm no longer affected by it's presence. I'm practically surrounded by it. I am it.

I first encountered this purpleness in the water surrounding my home. A very light tint that no others could recognize unless you lived here for decades.  I started makeshifting filters so I can drink it pure. Of course anything makeshift is going to be very flawed, so my invention was pointless.

Throughout the days I've became drowsy, cold, weak, and weirdly...confused. Not confused about the water...well yeah I was confused for that but everything in general. It's like my daily memory started to vanish.

Well, as you could guess the water got darker, the trees became gloomier, and the flowers became putried to stare at. Even my house started to get infected by this disease. How can a house turn into this!? Houses are not living things!

Well the nights went by, and after the rapture I've became fully immune after existing in it for so long. I succumb to the disease, and I even found the source. Under me is some abstract structure. That's where the source of the bad guys are coming from, that's the source of the water pollution...",
