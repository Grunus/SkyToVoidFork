Every person, every soul that died- of course only if you believed in the gods, and that's a lot of people we're talking about. Every soul needs a place to live, and space becomes an issue, so transportation is needed, and then all of that is placed on me, remembering every way and every tunnel leading to that home for each individual on my tram.
