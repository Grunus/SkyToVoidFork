    "DialogText": "You have exited mortal life and entered The Golden Gates. If you are reading this, you have been chosen to ascend. Welcome, my found souls, to The Kingdom of Gods.

You have ventured your journey, you have believed in us for centuries and you should now be fearless of the future, but what seems to have been lost in time is why we exist and why we're so merciful. Your whys will be answered before you step into the Kingdom. It is important that you understand us, because we understand you.

As you walk down the hall you now face, we will teach you our reasonings. You will see what we sacrificed. You will see what you sacrificed. You will see what debts we both pay.


Welcome to The Kingdom of Gods.",
