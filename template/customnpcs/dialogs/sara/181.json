You are the one looking for redemption. I applaud your ambition, and seeing the corruption with my own soul, I too want action. But I cannot intervene. They have all control of myself as I am but another claimed soul in the kingdom. I can only aid you with my enlightening prescence.
But, I can assure you, @p, they are scared.

Almost all of them are available if you can get to them. They are prepared to break you. They are prepared to scold you. They've created armies just for you. The highest of them all, as they call themself, Acceptance, will not reveal himself until you have obtain the four marks of grief.
